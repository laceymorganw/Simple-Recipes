# Creating-an-HTML-and-CSS-Website

I created this project and wrote the code as a coding boot camp instructor at The Tech Academy. This was then turned into a tutorial series of 10 short 8-10-minute videos. 

This project intended to give students at the Tech Academy a basic understanding of CSS, what it is, how to use it within HTML files, the importance of different CSS concepts such as order of importance, the difference between selectors (type, class, and ID), and to practice how different values and combinations can change the styling of an HTML element. 

This was built on a gradient the first section of files in the repo goes over HTML and CSS only I later added a new folder that includes JavaScript I kept this separate to keep my base files in their original form to create proper tutorial scripts to incorporate JavaScript.

The Adding JS to an HTML and CSS Website folder is the name of the tutorial video series that contains the updated code. The JavaScript takes all recipe buttons on the page and creates an array, then when an item is selected from the array the code then runs through which button was pressed and displays a pop-up model of the recipe ingredients and instructions. We then create a form validator and capture the form data and display it in the console.
