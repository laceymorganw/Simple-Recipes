**FEATURED RECIPE MAIN TEXT**
Deep dish pizza has got a lot going for it:
a thick crust that's tender and chewy on the inside,
but nicely crisped on the outside; a little extra room for piling
on the toppings; and, deep dish is less needy than its thin crust
style counterpart, which requires some care when rolling and stretching.
Here, you just push the dough into the skillet and you're cooking.
Save the leftovers for lunch!
